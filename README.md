# üß† Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis: Early-Life Antibiotic Exposure and Type 1 Diabetes Risk

This repository contains the materials supporting a systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) investigating the association between **early-life antibiotic exposure** and the subsequent risk of developing **Type 1 Diabetes** in childhood.

## üìù Overview

The project synthesizes findings from multiple observational studies to estimate the pooled effect size of antibiotic exposure on the risk of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).
